# Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Description

This project is a Python code example demonstrating the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It showcases how to define classes, create objects, utilize inheritance, and implement methods within a structured OOP framework.

### Why OOP Matters

OOP is a fundamental programming paradigm that promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability. It models real-world entities as objects with their own data and behaviors, making complex systems easier to design and manage.

## Installation

This project requires Python 3.x to be installed. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

No additional libraries or packages are needed.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python oop_course_example.py
   ```

### Code Structure

The code is organized into two classes:

- **`Course`:**  A base class representing a generic course. It contains attributes like `name`, `contact_website`, `office_address`, and methods for getting contact details and the head office location.
- **`OOPCourse`:** A subclass that inherits from `Course` and adds specific attributes like `course_id`, `description`, and `trainer`. It also includes methods to display trainer details and the course ID.
