### Task 1: Email Software

[[Link to Task 1 folder]](https://github.com/BabaJD/Email-software.git)

This Python script simulates a simplified email client. It allows you to:

* **Receive emails:** Pre-populated with sample emails.
* **View emails:** List the subject lines of all emails or just unread ones.
* **Read emails:** Display the full content of a specific email and mark it as read.
* **Exit:** Quit the application.

### Task 2: Driver Age Verification Software

[[Link to Task 2 folder]](https://github.com/BabaJD/Driver-age-verification.git)

This Python script determines whether a person is old enough to drive based on their age. It demonstrates the use of:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** It utilizes classes (`Adult` and `Child`) to model different types of individuals and their driving eligibility.
* **Inheritance:** The `Child` class inherits from the `Adult` class, showcasing how to reuse code and create specialized behaviors.
* **Conditional Logic:** An `if-else` statement checks the user's age and creates the appropriate object (either `Adult` or `Child`).
* **User Input:** The script gathers the user's name, age, hair color, and eye color. (Note: Hair and eye color are not used in the current implementation but could be for future enhancements.)
  
### Task 3: Student Registry Software

[[Link to Task 3 folder]](https://github.com/BabaJD/Student-Registry.git)

This Python script simplifies the process of collecting and storing student ID numbers for an exam registration. It does the following:

1. **Asks:** Prompts the user to input the number of students registering.
2. **Collects:** Gathers the ID number of each student using a loop.
3. **Stores:** Saves the ID numbers in a text file named `reg_form.txt`.

### Task 4: Task Manager Application

[[Link to Task 4 folder]](https://github.com/BabaJD/Task-Manager-Software.git)

This Python-based Task Manager application is a command-line tool for managing your to-do list. It offers basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks, along with persistent storage using a JSON file.

Key features include:

* **Task Creation:** Add new tasks with a title and description.
* **Task Listing:** View all tasks in your list.
* **Task Updating:** Modify the title or description of existing tasks.
* **Task Deletion:** Remove tasks from your list.
* **Data Persistence:** Your tasks are saved in a JSON file so they persist between sessions.

### Task 5: Sticky Note Web Application

[[Link to Task 5 folder]](https://github.com/BabaJD/Sticky-Notes.git)

This Django-based sticky notes application simplifies your note-taking and organization. It's a versatile tool for quickly jotting down ideas, reminders, or to-do lists. The app boasts customizable styling, search capabilities, and a responsive design for seamless use across devices.
